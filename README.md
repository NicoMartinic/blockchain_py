# blockchain_py

# This is a basic concept of how a blockchains and smart contracts works.
# It uses flask and postman to interact with the blockchain and the smartcontract. 
# The coin used (test) is just for testing, has real value. 
# The testcoinsport is to simulate different computers running within the same blockchain, also gives the possibility to interact with the smart contract to
# exchange/convert/send/recive the testcoins.
